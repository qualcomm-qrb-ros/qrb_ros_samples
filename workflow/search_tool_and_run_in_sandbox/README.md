# Plan + Code Execution + Tool Search Tool

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful LLM-powered research agent. This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/llm-agent-internal-as-a-graph-tutorial).

This specific project is inspired by : https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use

## Features (planing)

- Allow high-performance LLM to search available tools with usage and best examples
- Allow high-performance LLM to generate code blocks to use available tools exactly and check tool execution results
