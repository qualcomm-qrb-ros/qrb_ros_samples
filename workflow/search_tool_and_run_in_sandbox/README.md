# Plan + Code Execution + Tool Search Tool

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful LLM-powered research agent. This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/llm-agent-internal-as-a-graph-tutorial).

## Features (planing)

- Allow high-performance LLM to search available tools with usage 
- Allow high-performance LLM to generate code blocks to use available tools exactly and check tool execution results
- Tool search tool will use text embedding and compute dotproduct to get the best matching tools
- Code execution tool will based on pre-defined tool JSON schema and generate code
- Currently this project will use dummy tool calling
