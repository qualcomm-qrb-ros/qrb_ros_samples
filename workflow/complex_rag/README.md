# Prototype Complex RAG Scene

This implementation is based directly on the tutorial: [LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/llm-agent-internal-as-a-graph-tutorial).

This specific project is inspired by : https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use

**Modern RAG is usually a tough task since the Brute computation of Vectors' Cosine Similarity is not affordable in Data Exploration Era.**

**One of the common method to handle Vector Search Scene is using Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW).**

Check out explaination Video in **"Vector Database Search - Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) Explained"** : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77QH0Y2PYKg

## Features (planing)

- Use pre-downloaded 7M words of large text file
- Cut into chunks and build vector database with Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) 
- Search Vector with HNSW instead of Brute Computation
