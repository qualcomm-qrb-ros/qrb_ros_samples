# Minimal python sandbox based on Docker

We usually need to execute code blocks generated by LLM.

better to keep code execution in docker environment as community does a lot

## Features (planing)

- use ./_sandbox path to save runner.py outputs
- use _sandbox/requirement.txt to install your pip pkgs
- use _sandbox/runner.sh as Dockerfile entry
- mount ./_sandbox to /usr/local/sandbox
